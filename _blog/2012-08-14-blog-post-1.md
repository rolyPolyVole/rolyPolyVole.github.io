# Introduction

I have recently reached a rapid rating of 2100 on Chess.com. It's around this time where titled players start showing up, and sure enough, on March 18th 2025, I beat the first titled player I played against. It was a candidates master from Brazil, rated 2157.

# The Opening

The opening was a pretty standard open Sicilian defense, where both sides will castle short. White has a very small edge due to the extra central space and slight lead in development. Black still needs to develop the bishop to g6 and castle, before trying to equalize in the center.

# Severe Blunder #1

Then they traded on `c6`, and after `bxc6`, surprised me with `e5`. If I take the bishop then obviously my structure will get severely damaged after `exf6`, and the e-file also gets opened towards my uncastled king. I didn't like `dxe5` either, as this splits my pawns and I probably can't hold on to the extra e pawn. Though the computer suggests that this is objectively the best move. So naturally, I tried `Ng4`, going for the pawn with my knight instead, while their bishop is still attacked. This is a huge blunder but it's very hard to see why. White can play `Be2`, attacking the knight, and after `... Nxe5 f4` and suddenly my knight is out of squares and I lose a piece.

# Middlegame

Instead my opponent played `Bxc6`, distracting my bishop from the defense of my knight on `g4`. I'm down a pawn now, but I'm down a pawn in half of my games. After `... Bxc6 Qxg4`, I played `Bg7`, focusing on development instead of splitting my structure again with `dxe5`. My opponent played `e6`, again trying to weaken my structure, but I simply castled `O-O`. `Bg5` was played, and I responded with `f5`. They went `Qc4`, which was a bit surprising since I can gain a tempo with `Rc8`. They played `Nd5`, basically forcing me to take the knight with `Bxd5`. After `Qxd5`, I decided to just grab a free pawn with `Rxc2`. They challenged the file with `Rac1` but I didn't have anything better than to grab another free pawn, so I did just that with `Rxb2`.

# Severe Blunder #2

My opponent prepared a stack on the c-file with `Rc6`. I kicked the annoying bishop out with `h6`, and after `Be3`, I continued with `f4`. Then they made the decisive blunder with `Bxa7??`, which I capitalised on with `Qa8!`. Suddenly their `c6` rook is pinned, and their `a7` bishop is out of squares. The desired move is `Rc7`, infiltrating the seventh rank and defending the bishop, but that is met with `Qxd5`. The pin also disallows `Ra6` or `Bb6`.

# Finish

My opponent tried `Rfc1`, stacking on the c-file, but I simply took the bishop `Qxa7`. They tried to complicate things with `Rxd6`, but I finished the game in style with `... Qxf2+ Kh1 f3`. The pawn cuts off the queen's defense of g2 and mate is unstoppable. My opponent resigned and with that, I won my first game against a candidates master.
