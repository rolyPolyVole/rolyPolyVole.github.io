# About me
I'm a professional developer specialising in mostly backend development. I'm interested in creating high-quality software, especially games and game mods. I have experience in freelancing, through creating Discord applications and developing Minecraft servers. At the moment I'm working on some personal projects, which are listed under the **Projects** tab.

I'm also a strong chess player, and I often play in tournaments and online. I'm working towards my first FIDE title.
